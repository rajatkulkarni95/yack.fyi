# Pricing
    <div className='mt-8' />

Yack is still in beta, and under active development. We're working hard to make it the best it can be, and we're excited to share it with you.

---

As far as how much it will cost, we're still figuring that out. We want to make sure that Yack is affordable for everyone, and we're working on a pricing model that will make that possible. We'll be sure to let you know as soon as we have more information.

---

What we are certain of is, it would not be a subscription. We don't like subscriptions, and we don't want to force you to pay for something each month in hopes of upgrades and improvements.

**Pricing will be one-time, and you'll get all future updates for free.**
